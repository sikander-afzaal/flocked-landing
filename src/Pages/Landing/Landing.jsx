          flocked aims to provide the most efficient and worry free way to
          participate in the chikn ecosystem. chikn presents an incredibly
          rewarding, dynamic, and complex set of assets to optimally manage with
          limited resources. potential barriers of entry exist for new entrants
          in terms of time, defi knowledge, game strategy, and capital outlay.
          flocked strives to eliminate these barriers.

              electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
              popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
